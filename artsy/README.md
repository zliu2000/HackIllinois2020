Algo Map5-

***CURENTLY ONLY BUBBLE SORT IS FUNCTIONAL***
Built primarily centered around the open-source creative coding tool p5.js, Algo MAP5 is an open-source sorting algorithm visualizer. Implemented using REACT and javascript, it is a simple tool that can built upon to better visualize and understand various sorting and other algorithmic concepts.

***FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROJECT***
- polishing front end
    - being able to request simulations to be replayed
- implementing further sorting algorithms
- adding visual/audio customization features to increase engagement with students
